Requirements:

- See `mix.exs` for the required version of Elixir
  - you may comment this out and run on an alternate version, but you may encounter problems

1. Clone the repo to your desired location.
2. Make sure that you can build the _escript_ with `mix escript.build`.
3. Continue to [step 2][step-2]
