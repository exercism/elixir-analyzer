# A Guide to Writing an Elixir Analyzer Extension

## Step 2: The anatomy of an elixir analyzer extension

In this section we will look at two files:

- The example module file we will want to analyze
- The example Analyzer extension

### The example module

```elixir
# ./02-example-module.ex
defmodule Example do

  def hello(name) do
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end
end
```

Here we have a basic module that defines a single function `Example.hello/1`. If you are familiar with exercism practice exercises, this resembles the `two-fer` exercise.

### The example analyzer extension

An analyzer does not replace module unit tests, the goal of our analyzer is to tease out anti-patterns in passing solutions. Using this pattern detection, the goal is to provide clear, direct coaching to a student to correct the design choice.

```elixir
defmodule ElixirAnalyzer.ExerciseTest.Example do  # 1
  use ElixirAnalyzer.ExerciseTest                 # 2
end
```

This is the bare minimum of required code for an analyzer extension. There are a few things here to look at in more detail. Looking at line 1, we can see the naming convention used by the analyzer. An analyzer extension must be named `ElixirAnalyzer.ExerciseTest.__________` where the blank is the name of the module you want to analyze. In our case we can see in the code example, the name for our extension is `ElixirAnalyzer.ExerciseTest.Example`.

Line 2 allows the use of the macros found in `ElixirAnalyzer.ExerciseTest`, specifically the `feature/1` macro. This macro will allow us to specify tests and patterns that we want to identify in the solution being analyzed.

## How to use the extension

The extension module should then be placed into the `lib/` folder of the mix project, ideally in `lib/elixir_analyzer/test_suite/` folder for convention.

Then we can run the elixir analyzer:

```shell
> mix escript.build
Compiling 2 files (.ex)
Generated escript elixir_analyzer with MIX_ENV=dev

> ./elixir_analyzer example-slug path/to/example/folder path/to/output 
undefined analysis ... Completed!

Analysis ... Analysis Complete
Output written to ... path/to/output/analysis.json
```

We can then find `analysis.json` at the path specified with the contents:

```json
{"comments": [],"summary":"Submission analyzed. No automated suggestions found."}
```
