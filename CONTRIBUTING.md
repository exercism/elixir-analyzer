### Writing comments

All the Analyzer comments for all tracks are stored together in [exercism/website-copy][analyzer-comments]. When adding a new Analyzer check with a new comment, you need to open a corresponding PR in [exercism/website-copy][analyzer-comments] with that comment's content.

See [the Analyzer comment copy guidelines][analyzer-comments-guidelines] for guidance on how to write friendly and constructive Analyzer comments.
