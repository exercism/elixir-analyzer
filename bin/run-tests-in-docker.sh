# Synopsis:
# Test the analyzer Docker image by running it against a predefined set of 
# solutions with an expected output.
# The analyzer Docker image is built automatically.

# Output:
# Outputs the diff of the expected test results against the actual test results
# generated by the test runner Docker image.

# Example:
# ./bin/run-tests-in-docker.sh

set -e # Make script exit when a command fail.
set -u # Exit on usage of undeclared variable.
# set -x # Trace what gets executed.
set -o pipefail # Catch failures in pipes.

# build docker image
docker build --rm -t elixir-analyzer .

# run image passing the arguments
docker run \
    --rm \
    --network none \
    --read-only \
    --mount type=bind,src=$(realpath test_data),dst=/opt/analyzer/test_data \
    --mount type=tmpfs,dst=/tmp \
